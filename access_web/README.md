## Accessing Web Resources with Python

In this presentation, we use the Python packages Requests and Beautiful Soup in order to access and manipulate data from web pages. The Requests module lets you integrate your Python programs with web services, while the Beautiful Soup module is designed for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. We will explain how to access a web page, read and collect data, and work with the textual information available there. We will also introduce the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and learn how to get JSON objects from the web.


**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python programming.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Install (optional) on your local machine the Anaconda Python Distribution.
 We recommend that you install the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anaconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

You might find it useful to learn little more about Jupyter notebook:
