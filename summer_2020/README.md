<a href="https://datascience.berkeley.edu/blog/python-data-science/">Python is a free, a general-purpose, and portable programming language. It is easy to use with its simple syntax and readability, which makes the code easy to understand and maintain.</a> 
Python can be extended via libraries that can be used to tackle problems in machine learning, data analysis, and beyond. It has a vast ecosystem and a dynamic user's community that make Python accessible to everyone.

The focus of this course will be on Data Science.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science">Wikipedia</a>, **Data Science** is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It uses techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and information science.
Because of its features, Python is one of the preferred programming languages that data scientists can use to explore and analyze their datasets.
The <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">growth of Python in Data Science</a> has gone hand in hand with that of Pandas, External link  which opened the use of Python for data analysis to a broader audience by enabling it to deal with row-and-column datasets, import CSV files, and much more.

This course introduces the fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. In addition, it presents Python packages (Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas) used for data manipulation and visualization. This course provides the necessary foundations for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

### Objectives
You will learn the following topics:

- Python basic syntax, variables, and types
- Conditional statements and loops
- Data structures: list, tuple, dictionary, set
- Functions and modules
- I/O with text files
- Numpy arrays
- Basic visualization with Matplotlib
- Statistical visualization with Seaborn
- Data manipulation (reading data file, performing statistical analysis, visualization, handling time series data) with Pandas

At the end of this course, participants will be able to write their own Python scripts to read csv files, perform data wrangling, carry out basic statiscal analysis and visualize data.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Have a [Github](github.com) account. Github is a web-based collaborative
  tool to discover, share and build software. You might need to share what you do with your mentor. 
- Install on your local machine the Anaconda Python Distribution. It is not required but it is highly recommended if you plan to write Python code for your project.
 We recommend that you install the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)
- Install Git on your local machine by following the installation instructions: [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). This is not required but highly recommended.

**Classes will take place on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.**

### <span style="color: red">Starting Point</span>

### <span style="color: red">Introduction to Python</span>

If you have never been exposed to Python, you need to take this Introduction to Python course.  
In case you did some Python programming in the past and you want to assess your Python knowledge, take the following test (in less that 15 minutes and without using any help):
