## Object Oriented Programming with Python

Python has been created an object-oriented language. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This course presents the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Python. We use simple examples to learn the benefits of OOP and see how the main OOP concepts (such as Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance) can be used in Python applications.


**Prerequisites**: Familiarity with Python programming.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Install (optional) on your local machine the Anaconda Python Distribution.
 We recommend that you install the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anaconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

You might find it useful to learn little more about Jupyter notebook:
