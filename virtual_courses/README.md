# Virtual Python Courses

This page was created for the virtual Python classes. 
To fully follow all the topics below, you need to have a **gmail** account in order to access Google Colaboratory. Each course will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook. We assume that partcipants have the basic foundations (data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, modules, IO on text files) and are comfortable using a web browser.

### [Important Information](#)
- Do not forget to mute your microphone.
- The classes are meant to be interactive. 
- We hope that we will run the Python codes together. 
- At the end of class, do not forget to save your copy of the materials either in your Google Drive or your local platform.
- Do not hesitate to ask questions at any time.

### [Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution](#)
It is not required to have a Python distribution installed on your local machine. 
However, we believe that it is important to have one in order to write and run your Python
applications. We recommend that you install 
the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

In case you want to have basic foundations on Jupyter Notebook and Git, take the self-taught tutorials below.

| Lecture Topic | Interactive Link |
|---|---|
| **Introduction to Jupyter Notebook**  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/astg606/py_materials/blob/master/jupyter_notebook/jupyter_notebook_introduction.ipynb) |
| **Introduction to Git**  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/astg606/py_materials/blob/master/git_tutorial/basic_git_tutorial.ipynb) |
| **Running Python**  | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/astg606/py_materials/blob/master/welcome/running_python.ipynb) |

### <span style="color: red">Introduction to Pandas</span>

Pandas is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze tabular data using SQL-like queries. In this presentation, we will introduce the two Pandas data types and show examples on how Pandas is used to read csv data files, to manipulate the data and do basic visualizations.

**Prerequisites**: Numpy and Matplotlib

**Interactive Link**: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/astg606/py_materials/blob/master/pandas/introduction_pandas.ipynb)

### <span style="color: red">Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas</span>

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of preparing your data for modeling. EDA aims to find trends in the data and and to answer initial questions. In this presentation, we will define the main principles of EDA and apply those principles to find insights in a dataset.

**Prerequisites**: Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas

### <span style="color: red">Serialization and Deserialization with Python</span>

Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization. In this presentation, we will show how we can serialize/deserialize objects using the Python modules Pickle and Json. We will also explain the context in which each of the modules needs to used to perform serialization and deserialization.

**Prerequisites**: Python programming

### <span style="color: red">Accessing Web Resources with Python</span>

In this presentation, we use the Python packages Requests and Beautiful Soup in order to access and manipulate data from web pages. The Requests module lets you integrate your Python programs with web services, while the Beautiful Soup module is designed for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.. We will explain how to access a web page, read and collect data and work with the textual information available there.

**Prerequisites**: Python programming and basic HTML syntax
