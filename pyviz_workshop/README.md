# HoloViz Training Workshop

## Overview

This one-day course introduces participants to the open-source HoloViz family of
visualization libraries. The HoloViz project—previously referred to as PyViz —constitutes
a coordinated effort to facilitate browser-based data visualization in Python by making it
flexible, easy to learn, and easy to use. The HoloViz project entails several powerful
packages including [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/), [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/), 
[HoloViews](http://holoviews.org/), and [DataShader](https://datashader.org/). 
Participants will get practice deploying elementary interactive data visualizations using these libraries; we will
provide demonstrations of more sophisticated deployments.

The course will be delivered remotely using video-conferencing technology in conjunction
with our experiential learning platform, [Q-Hub](https://www.quansight.com/post/announcing-qhub)
 (a customized JupyterHub instance with all required Python software configured beforehand).

## Prerequisites

Participants should be comfortable with using Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and
should have decent working knowledge of the Python language. Specifically, they should
be well-versed with standard Python programming idioms (e.g., flow control, functions,
etc.) and common data types (e.g., lists, dictionaries, tuples, Pandas DataFrames and
NumPy arrays, etc.). No prior experience using other Python data visualization
frameworks (e.g., Seaborn, Altair, etc.) is expected but some familiarity with the
underlying visualization concepts underlying Matplotlib will be useful. Prior exposure to
Dask and Xarray will also be useful but neither is mandatory.

## Learning Objectives:

At the conclusion of this course, participants will be able to:
- Identify and explain core capabilities HoloViz components (e.g., Panel, HoloViews, Datashader, etc.).
- Deploy simple Panel apps combining plots and elementary interactive widgets.
- Customize content in Panel apps by modifying layout and interlinking reactive components with callbacks.
- Build plots with both the hvPlot and generic HoloViews constructors.
- Combine and customize HoloViews elements with standard idioms
- Construct interactive Panel apps deploying sophisticated data pipelines and HoloViews elements.
- Apply Datashader to avoid memory overflow when rendering dynamic plots with very large amounts of data.
- Build an advanced dashboard combining all hvPlot, HoloViews, Panel, and Datashader for interactive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Outline

- Overview of HoloViz libraries
- Using Panel to construct simple interactive dashboards
- Interlinking Panel widgets & reactive components
- Applying plotting interfaces: hvPlot, Datashader
- Constructing & composing HoloViews elements
- Customizing interactivity with callbacks, streams, & DynamicMaps
- Visualizing large datasets with Datashader
- Building pipelines for advanced dashboards
- Advanced demonstrations (e.g., EarthSim, LSST dashboards)

### [Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution](#)
It is not required to have a Python distribution installed on your local machine.
However, we believe that it is important to have one in order to write and run your own Python
applications. We recommend that you install
the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

### [Installing Git](#)
To install Git on your local machine, follow the installation instructions: [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)


To fully follow all the topics below, you need to have a **gmail** account in order to access Google Colaboratory. Each course will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
