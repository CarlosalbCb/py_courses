# Data Visualization

We provide a set of classes focusing on data visualization with Python.
Data visualization is the graphical representation (line plot, pie chart, histogram, contour plot, map, etc.) of information and data.
Data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, 
outliers, and, insights,  patterns in data.
The tools offer us the ability to see at a glance what matters. 
They are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions.

## Requirements

To take any of the course, you are expected to be familiar with Python and to have knowledge of Numpy, Pandas, Xarray.


### Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution

If you want to have a Python distribution on your local platform, 
we recommend using he Anaconda Python distribution. 
To install it, follow the instructions at: [Anconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/).
If you have a Mac, it is preferable to use the command line installation option.

## List of Courses

### Matplotlib

Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization. It is a cross-platform library for making 2D plots from data in arrays. It can be used in python scripts, shell, web application servers and other graphical user interface toolkits. In this course, we will present the anatomy of a Matplotlib figure and show to produce various 2D plots with Matplotlib.

### Xarray and Cartopy for Data Visualization

Xarray is an open-source library providing high-level, easy-to-use data structures and analysis tools for working with multidimensional labeled datasets and arrays in Python. Xarray combines the convenience of labeled data structures inspired by Pandas with the multi-dimensional arrays of NumPy and parallel out-of-core computation from Dask to provide an intuitive, powerful and scalable platform for scientific analysis. Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw Numpy-like arrays. It is particularly tailored to working with netCDF files. 
Cartopy is a Python package designed for geospatial data processing to produce maps and other geospatial data analyses.
In this course, we will show how to use Xarray and Cartopy to visualize geospatial data. We will also combine Xarray and Hvplot
to produce interactive and live plots.

### Introduction to GeoPandas

GeoPandas is a Python open-sourced library that extends the features of Pandas with the ability to read, analyze, and visualize geospatial data. It combines the capabilities of Pandas and Shapely, providing geospatial operations in Pandas and a high-level interface to multiple geometries to Shapely. In this course, we will introduce the basic data structure of GeoPandas (GeoSeries and GeoDataFrame), show a simple example on how to create such a data structure. We will then learn how to read various csv files (containing geospatial information) and create different types of maps.

### Interactive Visualization with HoloViews

HoloViews is an open-source Python library designed to make data analysis and visualization seamless and simple. It helps users understand their data better, by letting them work seamlessly with both the data and its graphical representation. HoloViews focuses on bundling users’ data together with the appropriate metadata to support both analysis and visualization, making users’ raw data and its visualization equally accessible at all times. In this course, we will learn how to create various plots (line plot, scatter plot, histogram, etc.) with HoloViews.

### Introduction to GeoViews

GeoViews is a Python library that facilitates the exploration and visualization of geographical, meteorological, and oceanographic datasets. GeoViews is built on the HoloViews library for building flexible visualizations of multidimensional data.
It adds a family of geographic plot types based on the Cartopy, plotted using either Matplotlib (static maps) or Bokeh (interactive maps).
In this course, we will first explore ways to plot a collection of points (represented by their latitudes and longitudes) on a map.
We will then learn how to plot model outputs data on maps.
