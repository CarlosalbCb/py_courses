## Python Tools for Earth Science

This course is meant to present few Python related tools for manipulating
Earth Science data. We plan to cover the following topics:

- Introduction to NetCDF4
    - Create nc4 files
    - Read nc4 files
    - Write a function that mimics the **ncdump** command
    - Compare two nc4 files
    - Create a new nc4 file from an existing one
    - Compute the average of time series data
    - Create monthly mean climatologies
- Visualization Geo-Located Data with Cartopy
    - Drawing maps
    - Overlaying data
    - Using images
    - Using shapefile files
    
We will mainly use Google Colab to run examples but we will also use the NCCS `discover`
platform to write applications.

**Prerequisites**: Participants are expected to be familiar with basic Python programming, and to have knowlege of Numpy and Matplotlib. A gmail account is needed.

To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Install on your local machine the Anaconda Python Distribution. It is not required but it is highly recommended.
 We recommend that you install the Anaconda Python distribution by following the instructions at: [Anaconda installation Guide](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/)

You might find it useful to learn little more about Jupyter notebook:
