# Introduction to Version Control with Git

Version control is a system that allows you to keep track of changes made to your code over time. It is useful for reverting back to specific versions of your code, and for collaborating on the same work with contributors. Git is a popular distributed version control system. In this lecture, we will have a quick introduction of version control and will present the features of Git. Through examples, we will learn how to create a local Git repository. Finally, we will create remote repositories in [Github](https://github.com/) and do some operations (clone, stage, commit, push, pull, etc.).

**Prerequisites**: Participants are expected to be able manipulate a web browser, to open command prompt window or terminal window and edit text files. A gmail account is needed.


To take this course, you are expected to:

- Have a gmail account (needed to have access to Google Colaboratory). Everything will be taught through the Google cloud based Jupyter notebook.
- Have a [Github](https://github.com/) account. Github is a web-based collaborative
  tool to discover, share and build software. You might need to share what you do with your mentor. 
- Install Git (not required though desirable) on your local machine by following the installation instructions: [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
